üêô TINCTA SAYS GOODBYE!
======================
It has been over 11 years that the first version of Tincta was released. For an octopus this is an exceptional age (most species live only about one year!).
However, Tincta is showing signs of ageing. Already on macOS Monterey, we noticed an increase of app crashes. In future versions of macOS, Tincta won‚Äôt launch anymore at all. We could neither locate nor fix these crashes.
Tincta‚Äôs codebase is over 10 years old and was originally built for MacOS Snow Leopard. Since then, macOS has moved on ‚Äî not only from cats to landmarks but also technically. But Tincta, being a free app, could not keep up.

So, it is time to say goodbye to the Kraken. This will be the last update for the time being.
Maybe some day Tincta will return from the depths if we find time to re-write the code base (or if someone else figures out how to fix those crashes and opens a pull request).


üö¢ WHERE WE'RE SAILING TO
=========================
We will now focus our resources on our other apps:

Loqbooq: A decision log for your team projects:
https://loqbooq.app

Macarons: A chat roulette app for Slack:
https://macarons-roueltte.app

Wokabulary: A flash card app for learning foreign language vocabulary (for Mac, iPhone, and iPad)

Check them out when you have some time!


üêü REPLACING TINCTA
===================
Abandoning Tincta affects ourselves the most as we use it daily in our work.
Finding an appropriate replacement was quite difficult.

However, we can recommend CotEditor. It is also open source and available for free from the Mac App Store.
CotEditor‚Äôs green tint will never feel as pleasant as Tincta‚Äôs squid purple but it‚Äôs still a great editor.
