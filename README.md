## Build

It should just compile with XCode. There are two caveats, though:

* We have our dev certificate setup in the project so you need to remove that or replace it with your own
* The App Store build includes the Sentry crash reporter. The private key is defined in the `SentryConfig.h` which is not included in the source. There is a `SentryConfig_Example.h` that you can use for your own Sentry account. Or you can delete all references to it alltogether and remove the import from `Tincta-AppStore-Prefix.pch`


## Support Development
Maintainance, App Store and website hosting is cross-financed from sales of Coding Friends' other apps.
